1.) Q. What is Computer?
    A. According to GCFGlobal.org a computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It is capable of storing, retrieving, and processing data.
    
2.) Q. What are the essential parts of computer?
    A. Base on GCFGlobal.org the basic parts of a desktop computer are the computer case, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and power cord. The hardware components of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and peripherals, as well as software
    components such as the operating system and applications.
    
3.) Q. Who are the notable inventors of hardware and software? Cite at least (5) Software dvelopers and (5) Hardware developers
    A.1 Software
    -Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) She is considered as the 1st computer programmer, she also created an algorithm intended to be processed by Charles Babbage's, making her the first that the machine could be used beyond pure calculation.
    -Alan Turing (1912-1954) A british mathematician anf logician, considered a father computer science, developed the Turing machine, an abstract mathematical model that laid the foundation for modern computers.  
    -John Backus (1924-2007) The one who led the team that developed FORTRAN (Formula Translaion) the first widely used high-level programming language, which revolutionized software development.  
    -Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011) He is the co-creator of the C programming language and key developer of the UNIX operating system.
    -Donald Knuth (1938) He developed the TeX typesetting system, which is widely used in academic for producing scientific papers.
    A.2. Hardware
    -Charles Babbage (1791-1871) The "Father of the computer", he designed the first mechanical computer.
    -Herman Hollerith (1860-1929) Invented the tabulating machine, an early electromechanical devices used for data processing. 
    -John von Neumann (1903-1957) Proposed the van Neumann architecture.
    -William Shockley (1910-1989) head of the solid-state physics team at Bell Labs that developed the first point-contact transistor.
    -John Bardeen (1908-1991) co-inventor of the transistor and in 1972, for the explanation of superconductivity. The transistor paved the way for all modern electronics, from computers to microchips.
